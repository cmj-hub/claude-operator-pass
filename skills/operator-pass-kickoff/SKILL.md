# Operator Pass Kickoff — adaptive router

## Activation

Loaded by `operator-pass` on bare invocation, or:
- "Operator Pass status"
- "Where do I start with the API"

## State detection

```python
state = {
    "env_var_set":       bool(os.environ.get("OPERATOR_PASS_API_KEY")),
    "has_brand_config":  file_exists("brand-config.json"),
    "has_soul":          file_exists("SOUL.md"),
    "key_valid":         api_get("/me") returns 200,
    "quota_remaining":   parse from /me response,
    "cache_dir_exists":  file_exists(".operator-pass-cache"),
    "recent_calls":      count of entries in usage.jsonl from last 7 days,
}
```

| State | Route to |
|---|---|
| `!env_var_set` | "Set OPERATOR_PASS_API_KEY. Subscribe at jaymountconsulting.com/operator-pass." |
| `env_var_set AND !key_valid` | "Key invalid or expired. Renew at jaymountconsulting.com/operator-pass." |
| `key_valid AND !has_brand_config OR !has_soul` | `operator-pass-onboarding` |
| `quota_remaining < 20%` | "⚠ Only X% quota remaining. Proceed carefully or upgrade." |
| `recent_calls == 0` | "No calls in the last 7 days. Want to try a sample call? `/operator-pass call cold-email-linter`" |
| else | "API ready. <quota>% quota. <N> recent calls. What do you want to do?" |
```
