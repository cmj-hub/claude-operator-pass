# Operator Pass — API Skill

Wraps the **JMC tools API** for use inside any Claude Code agent —
or any MCP-aware runtime. Each tool is a server-side, schema-validated,
real-result endpoint (not a prompt). Use them in your Claude / Cursor /
Codex / Gemini flows the same way you'd use a built-in tool.

## Bring your own key

This skill calls the JMC API. You need an active **Operator Pass**
subscription and an API key, exposed via env var:

```bash
export OPERATOR_PASS_API_KEY="jmc_live_..."
```

The skill detects a missing or invalid key and tells the user how to
subscribe:

> → Get an API key at https://jaymountconsulting.com/operator-pass

No key, no calls. The skill won't call the API anonymously.

## Quick reference

| Slash | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/operator-pass` | Interactive — detect intent, route to a tool |
| `/operator-pass list` | List all available tools + their input schemas |
| `/operator-pass call <slug>` | Call a specific tool with JSON inputs |
| `/operator-pass status` | Check API key validity + remaining quota |

## Available tools (current catalog)

The JMC tools API exposes 22+ multi-input modelers, generators, and
auditors. Each one is server-side, schema-validated, and returns
structured JSON (not LLM-narrated prose).

### Outbound + cold email

| Tool slug | What it does |
|---|---|
| `cold-email-linter` | Per-email score + line-level rewrite recommendations |
| `linkedin-post-critic` | Critique + 3 register-varied rewrites |
| `linkedin-hook-grader` | First-line hook scoring across 5 archetypes |
| `nurture-sequence-planner` | 5-email nurture stream with route-to-sales triggers |

### Foundation + targeting

| Tool slug | What it does |
|---|---|
| `evp-generator` | Schwartz-awareness EVP variants by tier |
| `evp-brief-generator` | Structured 3-tier EVP brief |
| `persona-from-crm` | CSV → AI clusters → PSPs per cluster |
| `offer-lever-scorer` | 5-lever offer score + rewrite |
| `buyer-journey-mapper` | ICP+pains → 5-stage Schwartz template |

### Demand + content

| Tool slug | What it does |
|---|---|
| `geo-visibility` | URL → 5-dim AI-visibility score + ranked fixes |
| `competitive-teardown` | URL → 6-bullet positioning teardown |
| `paid-media-teardown` | 5-lever ad creative teardown |
| `ad-creative-scorer` | Score against the JMC creative framework |
| `pricing-page-lab` | Tiers + decoy → rendered mock + rationale |

### Revenue + math

| Tool slug | What it does |
|---|---|
| `cohort-economics-modeler` | LTV/payback/cohort contribution + verdict |
| `channel-matrix-scorer` | Volume × ACV × Accessibility ranker |
| `blended-gtm-dashboard` | 11-slider dashboard, marquee modeler |
| `gtm-architecture-diagrammer` | Canvas + AI coherence audit |

(Full catalog + per-tool input schema at runtime via `/operator-pass list`.)

## Workflow

### 1. Validate the API key

On first call, validate:

```bash
curl -s https://api.jaymountconsulting.com/v1/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPERATOR_PASS_API_KEY"
```

If 401 or 403, surface:

> Your Operator Pass API key is missing / expired / invalid.
> Get or renew at https://jaymountconsulting.com/operator-pass.

### 2. Route to the right tool

Detect intent from the user's request:

| User says | Route to |
|---|---|
| "Lint this cold email" | `cold-email-linter` |
| "Critique this LinkedIn post" | `linkedin-post-critic` |
| "Generate an EVP" | `evp-generator` |
| "Build an EVP brief" | `evp-brief-generator` |
| "GEO audit on <URL>" | `geo-visibility` |
| "Competitive teardown of <URL>" | `competitive-teardown` |
| "Run the pipeline math" | `blended-gtm-dashboard` |
| "Score this ad creative" | `ad-creative-scorer` |

If intent is ambiguous, ask one clarifying question. Don't list tools
unless the user asks.

### 3. Gather the inputs per tool schema

Each tool publishes its input schema at:

```
GET https://api.jaymountconsulting.com/v1/tools/<slug>/schema
```

Fetch the schema, validate the user's inputs against it, and ask for
any missing required fields.

### 4. Call the tool

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://api.jaymountconsulting.com/v1/tools/<slug>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPERATOR_PASS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '<inputs>'
```

### 5. Surface the result

Each tool returns structured JSON. Pretty-print the result, then offer
"the next step" — usually:

- For audit tools (`geo-visibility`, `cold-email-linter`,
  `competitive-teardown`): "Want me to draft the fix for the top
  issue?"
- For generator tools (`evp-generator`, `nurture-sequence-planner`):
  "Want me to A/B test these variants against your existing copy?"
- For modeler tools (`blended-gtm-dashboard`,
  `cohort-economics-modeler`): "Want me to run a sensitivity analysis
  on the top 2 levers?"

## Sub-skills

- [`skills/operator-pass-call`](../skills/operator-pass-call) — invoke a specific tool by slug
- [`skills/operator-pass-list`](../skills/operator-pass-list) — list available tools + schemas

## Rate limits + costs

Each tool's API cost is included in your Operator Pass subscription.
Per-tool rate limits and any per-call cost are documented at:

→ https://jaymountconsulting.com/operator-pass/api

The skill respects rate-limit headers and tells the user when they're
throttled.

## Plugs into

Pairs especially well with:

- **[claude-cold-email](https://github.com/cmj-hub/claude-cold-email)** — `cold-email-linter` validates drafts; `linkedin-hook-grader` scores hooks
- **[claude-psp](https://github.com/cmj-hub/claude-psp)** — `persona-from-crm` clusters real prospect data into PSPs
- **[claude-evp](https://github.com/cmj-hub/claude-evp)** — `evp-generator` produces variants; `evp-brief-generator` produces full briefs

The free framework skills give you the methodology. The API gives you
the deterministic execution layer.
